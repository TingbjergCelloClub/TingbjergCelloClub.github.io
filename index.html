  <h1>Welcome, Musicians of Tingbjerg!</h1>

  <p>Are you a musician living in Tingbjerg and looking to connect with other local musicians? Hobbyist or professional, everyone's welcome!</p>

<p> I play the cello, and perhaps you've seen me zooming around Ruten, Lidl or Utterslev Mose with a big red case on my back. No, it's not a guitar. Yes, violin would have been easier.</p>
<p> I'm looking for a keyboardist/cellist to play and practice with. That's the main reason I set up this page. While at it, I figured I could help everyone else get connected! </p>
  <p>Send me an e-mail to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find bandmates for your next project.</li>
    <li>Discover other musicians for jams, collaborations, and open mics.</li>
    <li>Help build a vibrant community in Tingbjerg and engage with your peers and locals.</li>
    <li> Contact me if you know coding and websites, and you want to make this look nicer... Seriously, send help. I just wanted to get started immediately :D </li>
  </ul>
