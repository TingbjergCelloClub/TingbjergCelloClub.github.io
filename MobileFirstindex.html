  <h1>Tingbjerg Musicians Connect</h1>

  <p>Are you a musician living in Tingbjerg? This page is for you!</p>

  <p> I play the cello, and perhaps you've seen me zooming around Ruten, Lidl or Utterslev Mose with a big red case on my back. No, it's not a guitar. Yes, violin would have been easier.</p>
<p> I'm looking for a keyboardist/pianist/cellist to play and practice with. That's the main reason I set up this page. While at it, I figured I could help everyone else get connected! </p>

  <p>Connect with other local musicians, from hobbyists to professionals. Let's build a vibrant music community in Tingbjerg.</p>

  <h2>Looking for:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bandmates for your next project</li>
    <li>Jams, collaborations, and open mic partners</li>
    <li>Fellow musicians to practice and play with</li>
    <li> Contact me if you know coding and websites, and you want to make this look nicer... Seriously, send help. I just wanted to get started immediately :D </l
  </ul>

  <h2>Get Involved:</h2>
  <p>Contact me today to get started!</p>
